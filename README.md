=================

Tool for backuping all facebook messages

You need facebook API token, you can get one [here](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer?), do not forget to check read_inbox permission. (Well, it would be best for you if you check them all :))

How to use it? 

```
python backup.py
```

Thats it.
